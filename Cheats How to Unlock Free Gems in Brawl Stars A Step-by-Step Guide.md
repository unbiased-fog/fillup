Step 2: Participate in Events

Special Events: Brawl Stars often runs special in-game events, like
Brawl Pass events or limited-time modes, where you can win gems as part
of the rewards. Event Rewards: Completing these challenges could unlock
free gems in addition to other valuable rewards like tokens or coins.

Step 3: Level Up the Brawl Pass

Brawl Pass: The Brawl Pass offers additional rewards as you progress
through its levels. The free tier of the Brawl Pass includes gems, and
you can unlock even more gems as you level it up. You don't have to buy
the paid version to unlock some gems. Grind for Tiers: As you continue
to level up by completing daily and weekly quests, you'll earn more gems
and other valuable items!

Step 4: Achieve Achievements

In-Game Achievements: Brawl Stars offers a variety of achievements for
players who complete specific milestones, such as reaching certain
trophy milestones, leveling up Brawlers, or completing certain
challenges. Many of these achievements reward you with gems. Focus on
Milestones: Check your achievements tab for which ones you still need to
complete and work towards those to earn gems.

Step 5: Open Boxes

Brawl Boxes: As you play and earn trophies, you will receive Brawl Boxes
(Regular or Big Boxes). While gems aren\'t guaranteed, you can
occasionally pull gems directly from these boxes, especially as you
level up and unlock more rewards. Power Points and Items: Keep opening
boxes as you progress through the game, and you may get lucky with gems.

Step 6: Participate in Special Promotions

Seasonal Promotions: Supercell often holds special promotions or events
that reward free gems for completing certain tasks. Keep an eye out for
in-game announcements or social media updates about any upcoming events.
Celebrate Milestones: During holidays or updates, Brawl Stars may offer
promotions where you can earn gems by completing specific tasks or
challenges.

Step 7: Watch Ads for Rewards

Watch Ads for Free Rewards: Sometimes Brawl Stars offers players the
chance to watch short ads in exchange for small rewards, including gems.
Check the offer tab in-game for opportunities to earn gems this way.

Step 8: Refer Friends

Invite Friends: Some games have referral programs, and Brawl Stars is no
exception. Invite friends to join the game, and if they reach a certain
milestone, you can earn rewards, which may include gems.

Step 9: Stay Active in Events

Special Limited-Time Events: Brawl Stars often has events where players
can earn more gems through active participation. Keep an eye on these
special events as they pop up, because they might give out gems as part
of the event rewards.

Step 10: Keep an Eye on Updates

Updates and Announcements: Supercell frequently rolls out new updates
and promotions. Sometimes, these updates include bonus gems for logging
in or completing specific tasks. Make sure to stay updated with the
latest game news to maximize your chances of earning free gems.

Final Tips:

Be Consistent: The key to earning free gems is consistency. Completing
daily and weekly tasks regularly and participating in events will help
you steadily accumulate gems over time. Avoid Scams: Be cautious of any
third-party websites or apps claiming to give you free gems. These are
often scams and can result in your account being banned.

By following these steps, you can unlock free gems in Brawl Stars
without the need for hacks or cheats!
